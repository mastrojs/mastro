This is an example of a [Mastro](https://mastrojs.github.io) app connecting to a PostgreSQL database, demonstrating [HTTP streaming](https://mastrojs.github.io/docs/html-components/#http-streaming).

It uses Deno, but can be easily adapted to Node.js or Bun, by merging it with the [respective templates](https://mastrojs.github.io/#experienced-developers-%E2%80%93-do-you-want-off-the-frontend-treadmill%3F).
