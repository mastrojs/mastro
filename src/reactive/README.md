# Reactive Mastro

A tiny (2.7kB minzipped) reactive GUI library for your existing MPA. Reactive Mastro sits somewhere in between React/Vue/Solid/Svelte one one end, and Alpine/HTMX/Stimulus on the other end â€“ while being smaller and simpler than all of them.

Reactive Mastro was conceived as the client-side part of [Mastro](https://mastrojs.github.io/), but you can just as well use it with any other static site or server that renders HTML (such as Rails, Django, PHP, etc).
